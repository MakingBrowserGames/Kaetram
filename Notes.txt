Kaetram To-Do List:

- Begin moving all CSS to Sass

- Get proper button interfaces for "Login," "New Character" and "Back."
- Directly download map data from the server.

- Don't let target cell redraw when not necessary

- Save player orientation upon logout.


Finished:

- Convert the getPlayerData(player) method from MySQL to be directly inputted into query(``, {}); ✓
- Automate the MySQL database selection and creation process. ✓
- Music areas will be handled server sided - we must take as much load off the client as possible. ✓
- Move ornament to Vars.css ✓
- Add 'extra' to parsing of tiles ✓
- Use underscore for rendering ✓
- Fix the third scale ✓
- Finish basic tile-map rendering ✓
- Begin entity-rendering and distribution of sprites (scales accordingly) ✓


Reasoning:

- Have the pathfinding and movement client sided because the server is capable of verifying whether the player position is valid.
    The movement should be sent to the server when animation is done and calculated (in the future) for accuracy.
